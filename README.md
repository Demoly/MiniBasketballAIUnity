# MiniBasketballAIUnity

The objective of this project is to reproduze something similar to what Arnaldo made in his, but using unity and the 3d universe. Feel free to use it. Any comments or ideias enter in contact I will like to listen.

Project made based on the article "C# - Applying AI to a Multi-Agent 'Mini-Basketball' Game" from Arnaldo Pérez Castaño.
